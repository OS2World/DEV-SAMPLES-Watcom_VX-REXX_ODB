The MouseBox Sample
-------------------

This sample implements the VRMouseBox object, which is a subclass of
the VRPictureBox class.  It adds the following events to the PictureBox
object:

         MouseMove
         Button1Down
         Button1Up
         Button2Down
         Button2Up

In addition, it overrides the following property:

         Enabled

And intercepts the following window messages:

         WM_BUTTON1DOWN
         WM_BUTTON1UP
         WM_BUTTON2DOWN
         WM_BUTTON2UP
         WM_MOUSEMOVE     (overridden)

Besides showing how to create new event handlers, the source in
C\MOUSEBX.C shows how to set up VRInfo data.
